            There is roughly 1 child with Autism in every classroom in America. How do we best support these students to achieve their academic goals? 
        </p>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>
                What is Autism?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Autism is a hereditary condition which is currently classified in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) under the name <em>Autistic Spectrum Disorder</em> (ASD) and in order to be diagnosed, a person must exhibit <strong>persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts</strong> as well as <strong>restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities</strong> (CDC 2022).
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the reality of autism is much <strong>broader and more nuanced</strong> than this basic definition.
            </p>
            <p>
                As indicated by the name, ASD is a <strong>spectrum</strong>, meaning that there is a huge variety of ways that it can manifest. Most people with autism embody a <strong>subset</strong> of the traits associated with it, but <strong>not all of them</strong>. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <img src="./assets/spectrum.png" alt="The autistic spectrum: executive function, sensory processing, repetitive behaviors, motor skills, perseverative thinking, social awareness, verbal and nonverbal communication, information processing">
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                <strong>Historically</strong>, autism has been broken down into "high functioning" and "low functioning" categories. Nowadays, although some people with Autism undoubtedly experience greater difficulties than others regarding <strong>caring for themselves</strong> and <strong>integrating into neurotypical society</strong>, because we understand that autism is a spectrum of different traits and <strong>can't just be plotted on a line</strong> from "low" to "high" functioning, it's generally <strong>looked down upon</strong> to use these terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is a list of just some of the commonly associated traits of ASD:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hypersensitivities:</strong> being extra sensitive to certain sensations, (lights, sounds, etc.) to the point that being exposed to them can cause <strong>extreme discomfort</strong>. These can include light, volume, temperature, or specific sounds, textures, tastes, smells, or more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Difficulties with speech:</strong> this can range from never learning to speak to knowing perfectly well how to speak but just refusing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Difficulties with social cues:</strong> can be anything from reading body language, speech intonations, exhibiting empathy, taking things literally when they were meant figuratively or sarcastically, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Difficulties with fine motor control</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stimming behaviors:</strong> repetitive behaviors that autistic individuals may have, such as flapping one's hands, pacing, bouncing one's leg, or rocking back and forth. These behaviors are <strong>emotional regulators</strong> and are often performed when an individual is exhibiting some <strong>strong emotion</strong> like anxiety, frustration, excitement or happiness. Stimming is not purely exclusive to people with autism, if you've ever twiddled a pencil or used a stress ball, that could count as stimming too!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hyperfocus & difficulties with transitions</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Special interests:</strong> in keeping with the hyperfocus, autistic individuals often have <strong>specific, narrow areas of interest</strong> which they become incredibly invested in to the point of making it <strong>part of their identity</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Comorbid conditions:</strong> autism often appears alongside other learning disabilities, mental health issues and seemingly unrelated disorders, such as ADHD, audial processing disorders, language disorders, anxiety, depression, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>
                The Issue
            </h2>
            <p>
                Autism on its own is not necessarily disabling. Many individuals with autism have lives, careers and social relationships which are just as rich and fulfilling as anyone else's, which is why many choose to refer to it as a form of <strong>neurodiversity</strong> rather than a <strong>disorder</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A major portion of the difficulties which autistic individuals face today are simply due to the fact that <strong>our societies and our classrooms are not designed with autism in mind.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                A large scale survey of teachers, parents and students by Autism CRC, Australia's national research instution for the study of best practices for autism, identified the following as important <strong>areas of need</strong> for public school students with autism.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>
                Social Demands
            </h3>
            <p>
                Students with and without autism face immense social pressures at school, between navigating complex social dynamics, collaborating in group projects, and coping with bullying. However, for autistic individuals who struggle with fitting in and understanding social cues, these challenges can be even more daunting.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Overstimulation
            </h3>
            <p>
                When students with autism are placed in environments with excessive noise, lights, or other things to which they may be hypersensitive, this can be a major source of anxiety for them and can impair their ability to focus on the task at hand. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Executive Function Skills
            </h3>
            <p>
                Like their peers with ADHD, students with autism often struggle with a set of skills known collectively as executive function, which can be broadly summarized as the ability to create, organize, and follow through with plans in order to achieve long-term objectives. Executive function skills are vital to success in academia and so students who struggle with them may need special support in order to succeed. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Transitions
            </h3>
            <p>
                Autistic individuals typically thrive in the routine and familiar, but they struggle when faced with unexpected change. Thus, in an average school day, when students spend over an hour of time just transitioning from class to class, these transitions can understandably be a great source of stress for students with autism.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Handwriting
            </h3>
            <p>
                Some people with autism experience difficulties with fine motor skills and thus can struggle to write neatly enough for a teacher to understand, or to write quickly enough to take notes on a fast-paced lecture.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h2>What can we do as teachers?</h2>
            <p class="quote">
                "There really is no agreement within the field about what constitutes effective, evidence-based treatment for the entire range of people with autism." (Masibov & Shea, 2011)
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of the <strong>heterogeneity</strong> of experiences within the autistic community, experts mostly agree that there is <strong>no one-size-fits-all solution</strong> for working with students who are on the spectrum.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, every student's needs must be addressed on an individual basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                That said, there are many known supports that we can use in our teaching to benefit specific students, starting with the design of the classroom itself.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Lighting
            </h3>
            <p>
                Pay attention to the light level in the room. It should be bright enough to work, but not overwhelmingly bright as this can bother students who are hypersensitive to light. If a student has a severe hypersensitivity, they may benefit from the option to work somewhere darker and more secluded.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Volume
            </h3>
            <p>
                Likwise, classrooms can often get quite loud, which can bother students who are hypersensitive to noise. Maintaining a reasonable volume in the classroom as well as offering the option to work somewhere quieter and with fewer distractions may be beneficial.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Sensory Escapes
            </h3>
            <p>
                Regardless of what you do, some students with autism will need opportunities to escape from whatever may be a source of overstimulation for them. Reserving a corner of the classroom for relaxation with comfortable seats, headphones and/or fidget toys can provide students with that opportunity to escape when needed.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Clearly Defined Spaces
            </h3>
            <p>
                Creating distinct boundaries between sections of the classroom, for example with colored tape on the ground, will help students to navigate and to understand what is meant when you give instructions relating to those spaces.
            </p>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>
                Other Supports
            </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>
                Warnings Before Transitions
            </h3>
            <p>
                To mitigate the stress of constant transitions for students with autism, it is helpful to give advance warnings when a transition is about to occur. For example, giving a 5 minute warning before the end of class, or before the end of a group activity.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Allow Typing Instead of Handwriting
            </h3>
            <p>
                Although handwriting has some educational benefits over typing, especially when it comes to note-taking and memory formation, students who struggle with their handwriting may benefit from being permitted to type their work instead, as being forced to handwrite even when their writing is barely legible can be frustrating and humiliating, which can in turn lead to feelings of discouragement and burnout.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Provide Access to Course Materials
            </h3>
            <p>
                Students with autism may struggle to keep up with the pace of class lectures, either because they cannot handwrite their notes fast enough, or because they have a comorbid learning disability which impacts their ability to process information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allowing students to take photographs of the white board, and providing them with ways to access the course lecture slides or recordings of class meetings outside of class allows them the opportunity to review the information at their own pace so they can fully absorb it.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Incorporate Special Interests into Lessons
            </h3>
            <p>
                Students with autism tend to be very passionate about their special interests. Use this passion to your advantage! Including references to their special interests in lessons or allowing students to do individual projects about their special interests can be a great way to get them engaged while also showing you care about them as individuals.
